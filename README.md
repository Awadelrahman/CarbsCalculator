# What is CarbsCalculator
This project aims to build a machine learning based API that inputs an image of a food and estimates its carbohydrates content. This is extremely useful for diabetes patients. 
Normally a diabetes patient needs to calculate the carbs content of every meal to be given the correct insulin dose. Facilitating this with such API/App/software will make it easy for both adults and children to be safe and stay healthy.

# Dataset  
Image dataset is required that is labeled with carbs contents.

# Content  
This project is still in the early development phase and it is 100% individual effort, however collaborations are highly appreciated.
